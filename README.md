Simple MEAN e-commerce application with seed

This is a basic MEAN application which has

- user Create, Read, Update
- user authentication
- product database
- product seed
- dynamically generated filter navigation 
- paypal checkout

This is not a complete application. It's a fast starting point for a new application. 

To get started with this you will need to set environment variables 
DATABASEURL : the url for your mongodb
OURSECRET : the secret you wish to use to generate user salt/hash

You'll want to expand your RESTful routes to match whichever features you desire. 

Though the application allows for user registration/login/logout/authentication + Get/Update routes for
user profile, the user and commerce aspects of the application are independent each other. 

Simply cut out features you wont use and expand on the ones you will. 

This may not be the prettiest/best MEAN ecommerce module, but it beats writing everything from scratch if you're in a hurry.
